# dynamaXis Media Center
All public dynamaXis Media Center releases from clyveTV v3.2 to dynamaXis Media Center IV 4.2 Deep Space. [dXMCenter will no longer recieve updates as I have moved on to more advanced projects]
# What is it?
dynamaXis Media Center is a HTML based media center for accessing websites from the comfort of your TV.
# Why did you stop it?
It eventually got boring and difficult to make, so I retired it so that I could work on newer projects. The final build is its own web browser based of Microsoft.Web.WebViewer2.
# How do I open it? (for v3.2 and 3.3)
Double-click on the .html file and it will start in your web browser.
# How do I open it? (for v4.0 and IV 4.1 Deep Space)
View the ReadMe for more information on how to start this version.
# How do I open it? (for IV 4.2 Deep Space)
Make sure you have the .NET 6.0 Framework installed (it will prompt you to install it if not) then click on the .exe. Then, it will take you to a file viewer. Navigate to the directory containing the files for the app (where you clicked .exe) and click once on clyveTV 4.html.
# Will you ever create a C# based sequel to dynamaXis?
Yeah! I had a ton of fun making it! I'm just not really working on it right now. But maybe I'll begin development soon...
